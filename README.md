An elevator simulation system, including a GUI (which was designed by Christopher Hield). The XML input file accepts parameters for variable amounts of:

  1. elevators
  2. floors
  3. elevator capacity
  4. elevator travel speed between floors (seconds)
  5. elevator doors open time (seconds)
  6. elevator idle time until returning to first floor (seconds)
  7. amount of time for the program to sleep between cycles of activity (seconds)
  8. number of people generated per minute with random start/destination floors
  9. duration of the program (seconds)
